I provide those two classes of Elements usually not present in Schemdraw default libraries:

CustomNFet
CustomPFet

Feel free to use them in your schematics
Also the composition is quite intuitive, feel free to use parameters to modify the shapes.

Recall to import the right modules.
I leave an example of usage: check main.py
